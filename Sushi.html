          <p>Peel, quarter and thinly slice potatoes. Rinse in cold water until water is clear of excess starch.
Place potatoes in a 12-quart kettle, cover with water and then add 2 extra quarts of water. Put
onion in blender with a little water and reduce it to liquid. Add onion and salt to potatoes. Boil
until potatoes are soft. DO NOT POUR OFF LIQUID. With potato masher, reduce about 3/4 of
the potatoes to a puree. Cut fish into chunks and add to potato puree. Put whole tomatoes in
blender for 2 seconds to break them up and add to potato puree along with tomato soup. Cook
until the fish flakes, then turn down heat. Add pepper, butter, half & half and soda crackers.
Add hot water to give mixture the consistency of a medium-thick soup. Simmer for a half hour.
Then eat and enjoy. Freezes nicely. Crayfish should be cooked live; the meat spoils quickly when they die. Before boiling, dump
crayfish into an ice-cold, salt-saturated water bath. This will render the shellfish unconscious
for a few minutes, making them easier to handle. If the shellfish come from clean water, there
is no need to devein them before cooking.
Add desired seasonings (pickling spies are one suggestion) to pot of water and bring to rolling
boil. Add crayfish, cover and cook 10 minutes. Remove crayfish from pot and drop into ice
water to make meat easier to remove.
To remove meat, grasp crayfish body in one hand, tail in the other. Twist tail and pull from
body. Grasp tail in two hands and twist at center to open shell. Remove meat and serve with
melted butter or cocktail sauce. Once the meat is extracted, it can be substituted for shrimp or
lobster meat in a wide variety of dishes – salads, soups, canapés, newburgs or other creamed
dishes.
Crayfish (or crawfish) are considered a great delicacy in the southern United
States and in Europe, where gourmet restaurants always have “écrevisse” on
the menu. </p>
