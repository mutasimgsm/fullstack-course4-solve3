          <p>1. Clean, wash and cut lamb into medium sized pieces.
2. Heat oil in a thick bottomed pan. Add asafoetida,
cinnamon, cloves, black peppercorns and cardamom.
Sauté for half a minute.
3. Add lamb pieces and cook on a medium flame, stirring
constantly till lamb pieces get a reddish brown color. This
may take 12-15 minutes.
4. Sprinkle a little water and repeat cooking of lamb for 12-
15 minutes on a slow flame. Make sure to stir constantly
and scrape all the sediments from the bottom of the pan.
5. Add red chili powder, coriander powder, aniseed
powder, dry ginger powder and salt.
6. Add beaten Curd/Yogurt and 2 cups of water. Cook
covered till lamb is tender.
7. Traditional Kashmiri Rogan Josh has a thin gravy and
has a thick layer of fat/oil on top. This dish is enjoyed best
with steaming hot boiled rice. 1. Wash and cut the meat into 2 inch cubes.
2.Slice the onions into thin long pieces and also cut the ginger
and garlic separately.
3.Heat a teaspoon of ghee on a tava and roast the chilies till
dark in color. Fry the coriander seeds, garlic and ginger
separately in the same way, using just 1 teaspoon ghee for
each ingredient. Keep these fried spices aside.
4.In a large saucepan, heat the remaining ghee and fry the
onions till golden brown and crisp and keep aside.
5.Now add the cloves, cardamoms and cinnamon to the ghee
and fry, put the mutton and turmeric powder and salt. Cover
and cook till the meat is half cooked.
6.Pour a little water on the lid of the saucepan while cooking
to avoid the meat from sticking to the bottom. Add the curds
and remaining spices and mix and cook on low heat till the
meat is tender. If necessary add a cup of warm water.
7.Just before serving mix in the lemon juice and fried onions
and garnish with chopped coriander leaves.</p>

        <p>1. Build a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium. Put the
shrimp in a large bowl and toss with the oil to coat lightly all
over. Just before putting on the grill, sprinkle the salt evenly
over the shrimp and toss well to make sure each shrimp is
thoroughly coated in a crust of salt. Do not use fine-grain
kosher salt, as it melts too quickly.
2. Place the shrimp in the center of the cooking grate, and
grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until the shrimp are pink
and the flesh is opaque. Serve immediately with the dipping
sauce.
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon zest and juice.
Stir in the garlic. Add the oregano leaves. Let sit for at least
20 to 30 minutes to marry the flavors — or make up to 12
hours in advance. Add a grind of pepper, just before serving.
Use the sauce within 24 hours. 1. In a large bowl, add the chicken wings and KC Masterpiece®
Buffalo Marinade and stir until well coated. Cover the bowl
tightly with plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour.
2. Preheat grill with charcoal until coals are just turning gray.
3. In a medium bowl, add the honey, orange zest, paprika,
cayenne, butter, salt and pepper, and stir until well blended.
4. Arrange the wings, skin side up, in a single layer on the grill.
Discard any leftover marinade. Cook the wings for 7 to 9
minutes over medium heat. Turn the wings over and cook
for another 5 to 7 minutes. Then baste liberally with the
honey glaze and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes or until
the wings are crisp and the glaze has melted. Discard any
leftover glaze.
5. In a small bowl, add the mayonnaise, sour cream and lemon
juice, and stir until smooth. Fold in the blue cheese just until
combined. Cover the dip tightly with plastic wrap and chill</p>

        <p>Peel, quarter and thinly slice potatoes. Rinse in cold water until water is clear of excess starch.
Place potatoes in a 12-quart kettle, cover with water and then add 2 extra quarts of water. Put
onion in blender with a little water and reduce it to liquid. Add onion and salt to potatoes. Boil
until potatoes are soft. DO NOT POUR OFF LIQUID. With potato masher, reduce about 3/4 of
the potatoes to a puree. Cut fish into chunks and add to potato puree. Put whole tomatoes in
blender for 2 seconds to break them up and add to potato puree along with tomato soup. Cook
until the fish flakes, then turn down heat. Add pepper, butter, half & half and soda crackers.
Add hot water to give mixture the consistency of a medium-thick soup. Simmer for a half hour.
Then eat and enjoy. Freezes nicely. Crayfish should be cooked live; the meat spoils quickly when they die. Before boiling, dump
crayfish into an ice-cold, salt-saturated water bath. This will render the shellfish unconscious
for a few minutes, making them easier to handle. If the shellfish come from clean water, there
is no need to devein them before cooking.
Add desired seasonings (pickling spies are one suggestion) to pot of water and bring to rolling
boil. Add crayfish, cover and cook 10 minutes. Remove crayfish from pot and drop into ice
water to make meat easier to remove.
To remove meat, grasp crayfish body in one hand, tail in the other. Twist tail and pull from
body. Grasp tail in two hands and twist at center to open shell. Remove meat and serve with
melted butter or cocktail sauce. Once the meat is extracted, it can be substituted for shrimp or
lobster meat in a wide variety of dishes – salads, soups, canapés, newburgs or other creamed
dishes.
Crayfish (or crawfish) are considered a great delicacy in the southern United
States and in Europe, where gourmet restaurants always have “écrevisse” on
the menu. </p>
