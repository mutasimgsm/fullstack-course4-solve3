          <p>1. Build a charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium. Put the
shrimp in a large bowl and toss with the oil to coat lightly all
over. Just before putting on the grill, sprinkle the salt evenly
over the shrimp and toss well to make sure each shrimp is
thoroughly coated in a crust of salt. Do not use fine-grain
kosher salt, as it melts too quickly.
2. Place the shrimp in the center of the cooking grate, and
grill for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until the shrimp are pink
and the flesh is opaque. Serve immediately with the dipping
sauce.
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon zest and juice.
Stir in the garlic. Add the oregano leaves. Let sit for at least
20 to 30 minutes to marry the flavors — or make up to 12
hours in advance. Add a grind of pepper, just before serving.
Use the sauce within 24 hours. 1. In a large bowl, add the chicken wings and KC Masterpiece®
Buffalo Marinade and stir until well coated. Cover the bowl
tightly with plastic wrap and chill for at least 1 hour.
2. Preheat grill with charcoal until coals are just turning gray.
3. In a medium bowl, add the honey, orange zest, paprika,
cayenne, butter, salt and pepper, and stir until well blended.
4. Arrange the wings, skin side up, in a single layer on the grill.
Discard any leftover marinade. Cook the wings for 7 to 9
minutes over medium heat. Turn the wings over and cook
for another 5 to 7 minutes. Then baste liberally with the
honey glaze and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes or until
the wings are crisp and the glaze has melted. Discard any
leftover glaze.
5. In a small bowl, add the mayonnaise, sour cream and lemon
juice, and stir until smooth. Fold in the blue cheese just until
combined. Cover the dip tightly with plastic wrap and chill</p>
